# Virtual Blind man's buff #

## Introduction ##

Virtual Blind Man's Buff is a virtual remake of the popular children's game. A blindfolded player has to locate and collect items just by carefully listening.

It is a project we did for the lecture _Introduction to Augmented Reality_ at _Technische Universität München_.

## Software ##
The program was written in Qt using QtCreator. The OpenCV libraries were responsible for marker detection and the OpenAL library manages the sound output

## Equipment ##
You have to have a blindfold, a Dolby 5.1 sound system and a web camera in order to play the game.
